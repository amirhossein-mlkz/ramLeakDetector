#  RamLeakDetector
A lightweight memory leak monitoring tool for Python applications.

## Step 1: Initialization
In your application, create an instance of the `RamLeakDetector` class:

```python

detector = RamLeakDetector()

```
## Step 2: Start Your Application

Run your software normally and allow it to complete its initial execution loop, so memory is occupied as usual.

## Step 3: Start Monitoring
Once the application is stable:
Press `Ctrl + Alt + S` to \*\*start memory monitoring\*\*.
A folder will be created at:

```
<project\_directory>/ramLeak.logs/RamLeakRecorder
```
The session folder will be named:
```
RamLeakDe\_<current-date>\_<current-time>
```
Memory snapshots are taken \*\*every 30 seconds by default\*\*.
  
## Step 4: Let the App Run
Let the application run under realistic usage to allow memory leaks to develop.  
We recommend at least \*\*10 minutes\*\* of runtime.

## Step 5: Export Memory History
When you suspect a memory leak has occurred:
Press `Ctrl + Alt + E` to \*\*export the memory history\*\*.
A file named `history.hist` will be generated in the session folder.

## Step 6: Generate Plots and Report
To visualize and analyze the memory data:
Press `Ctrl + Alt + P` to generate output:
A `plots` subfolder will be created, containing memory usage graphs sorted by growth rate.
`report.txt` file will be generated, summarizing findings and highlighting leak-prone areas.

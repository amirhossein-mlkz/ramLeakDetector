# \# 🧠 RamLeakDetector

# 

# A lightweight memory leak monitoring tool for Python applications.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 📦 Step 1: Initialization

# 

# In your application, create an instance of the `RamLeakDetector` class:

# 

# ```python

# detector = RamLeakDetector()

# ```

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🏁 Step 2: Start Your Application

# 

# Run your software normally and allow it to complete its initial execution loop, so memory is occupied as usual.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## ⏱ Step 3: Start Monitoring

# 

# Once the application is stable:

# 

# ➡️ Press `Ctrl + Alt + S` to \*\*start memory monitoring\*\*.

# 

# \- A folder will be created at:

# &nbsp; ```

# &nbsp; <project\_directory>/ramLeak.logs/RamLeakRecorder

# &nbsp; ```

# \- The session folder will be named:

# &nbsp; ```

# &nbsp; RamLeakDe\_<current-date>\_<current-time>

# &nbsp; ```

# \- Memory snapshots are taken \*\*every 30 seconds by default\*\*.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## ⏳ Step 4: Let the App Run

# 

# Let the application run under realistic usage to allow memory leaks to develop.  

# 💡 We recommend at least \*\*10 minutes\*\* of runtime.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 📤 Step 5: Export Memory History

# 

# When you suspect a memory leak has occurred:

# 

# ➡️ Press `Ctrl + Alt + E` to \*\*export the memory history\*\*.

# 

# \- A file named `history.hist` will be generated in the session folder.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 📈 Step 6: Generate Plots and Report

# 

# To visualize and analyze the memory data:

# 

# ➡️ Press `Ctrl + Alt + P` to generate output:

# 

# \- 📂 A `plots` subfolder will be created, containing memory usage graphs sorted by growth rate.

# \- 📄 A `report.txt` file will be generated, summarizing findings and highlighting leak-prone areas.
